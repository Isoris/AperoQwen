For my master thesis at the Asian Institute of Technology, I study the immune response of the fish tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) to whole cell killed vaccines. 

The vaccines are monovalent and bivalent formulations against the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas veronii and against the pathogenic bacterium Streptoccocus agalactiae.

This online book will be updated regularly during the research. 

My research consists of 6 work packages: 

+ WP1 - Project organisation

+ WP2 - Pond, fish and husbandry

+ WP3 - Immunization, fish swab

+ WP4 - Lab assays to monitor immune response

+ WP5 - Challenge test

+ WP6 - Ethics requirements

I made the effort to port some of my work and progress into this bookdown website and share it with you.
