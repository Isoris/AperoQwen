      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.&amp;rdquo;
  me, only somewhat kidding  You can read the previous post about my &amp;ldquo;Spoonful of Hugo&amp;rdquo; series here. In this series, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing small spoonfuls of Hugo that I have learned that hopefully can help you get your site UP (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated).
This is my second post in this series, and it is a relatively quick one.</description>

      <description>I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and am a proud ramblin&#39; wreck from Georgia Tech. I received my PhD in psychology and quantitative methods from Vanderbilt University in 2008. Prior to joining RStudio, I was an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and an Associate Professor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University (OHSU). At OHSU, I was an NIH-funded Principal Investigator and an Assistant Center Director.
My research focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be teaching a new workshop at the upcoming rstudio::conf in January called &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse&amp;rdquo;, with my colleague Garrett Grolemund. Our workshop just sold out over the weekend! 🎉
It is always hard to develop an entirely new workshop, especially if you are doing it at the same time as learning how to use a new API. It is even harder when that API is under active development like the tidymodels ecosystem!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.&amp;rdquo;
 me, only somewhat kidding   As a happy blogdown user, a common story I hear from other #rstats users is that you try to change one little thing in Hugo, and the whole site breaks. Here be dragons for folks who aren&amp;rsquo;t web developers.
I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you that there are small spoonfuls of Hugo that can help you get your site UP (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated), even if you are not in the least bit interested in transitioning into a career in web development 😏.</description>

      <description>METHODS: Participants were 5053 children with confirmed diagnosis of ASD in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network. Measured values for weight and height were used to calculate BMI percentiles; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for BMI for gender and age were used to define overweight and obesity (85th and 95th percentiles, respectively).
RESULTS: In children age 2 to 17 years, 33.6% were overweight and 18% were obese. Compared with a general US population sample, rates of unhealthy weight were significantly higher among children with ASDs ages 2 to 5 years and among those of non-Hispanic white origin.</description>
